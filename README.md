# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using PyTorch & OpenCV

This project implements a handwritten digit recognizer using a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits on a canvas using the mouse, and the model will instantly predict the digit using a PyTorch model.

## Features
- Interactive drawing canvas
- Real-time digit prediction
- CNN trained on MNIST dataset
- GUI using OpenCV

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```
- Draw digit with mouse
- Press 'P' to predict
- Press 'C' to clear canvas
- Press 'Q' to quit

## Training (Optional)
```bash
python train.py
```
